# JunoNav

Role
====

Juno acts as an interactive campus assistant for new students, visitors, or anyone not yet familiar with the campus map and bus üöç schedule.

Main Tasks
==========

In this project, we will implement the following main features:

1.  Voice-Activated Q&A interaction---Users can ask questions via voice, and the system will recognize their speech and respond with a text answer. For example, it can provide the opening hours of common campus locations by matching keywords.

2.  Campus shuttle options --- The system will offer travel suggestions for campus shuttle routes, which will be replied to in TTS (text-to-speech) in response to user queries.

3.  Language Mode Switching (for International Students)---To support international students during orientation, Juno can switch its STT/TTS pipeline between English and Malay upon a voice request (e.g., "Speak Malay?"), delivering all subsequent interactions in the selected language.

Subtasks
========

1.  Voice-based Q&A interaction

Wake-Word Detection

Use a ROS wrapper around Porcupine or Snowboy (e.g.,  porcupine_ros) to publish a /wake_word Bool message.

Speech-to-Text (STT)

Leverage a cloud STT node (e.g., google_speech_ros) that subscribes to /audio_raw and publishes /stt/text.

Intent & Keyword Extraction

Run a small NLU node (could even be a Python ROS node using Rasa NLU or simple regex/rule-based logic) that listens on /stt/text and outputs an /intent topic.

Knowledge-Base Lookup

Implement a ROS service (/campus_info_service) that your NLU node calls, backed by a JSON/SQLite database.

Response Formatting & TTS

Have a dialogue_manager node format the reply and call the standard sound_play package or a cloud TTS node (publishing on /tts/audio), which then plays back on the speaker.

2.  ### Campus Shuttle Options Display

Shuttle Schedule Database\
Store the routes, stops, and departure times in a JSON or CSV file under config/.

Shuttle Intent Detection\
Extend the existing NLU node to recognize "shuttle" queries ("When's the next shuttle to North Campus?").

Route Selection Logic\
In the /shuttle_query service callback, filter the schedule by origin/destination and current time, then pick the next departure.

TTS (Text-to-Speech) Response\
Publish a single  std_msgs/String message on  /tts/text  containing, for example:

The next shuttle to KK12 is at 14:00.¬†

It will stop at UM Central, KK10, APIUM, KK11, and KK12.

Fallback\
If a destination is not recognized, publish a std_msgs/String message on /tts/text  though TTS prompting another destination.

3.  ### Language Mode Switching

Language-Switch Intent Detection

Extend nlu_processor_node to recognize a new language_switch intent and extract the target language entity (e.g. "English" or "Bahasa Melayu") from /stt/text.

Language Manager

Create a language_manager_node that subscribes to /intent (or a dedicated /language_switch topic), validates the requested language against supported options, and sets a ROS parameter or publishes the current mode on /language_mode.

Dynamic STT Configuration

Modify stt_client_node to read the  /language_mode parameter before each transcription request and pass the appropriate language code (en-US for English, ms-MY for Malay) to the STT API.

Dynamic TTS Configuration

Update tts_client_node so it likewise reads /language_mode and selects the matching voice/language code when publishing text to /tts/text.

Translation Service (for Dynamic Replies)

(Optional) Implement a /translate_text ROS service that takes an English string and target language, calls a translation API (e.g., Google Translate), and returns the localized string for TTS or display.

Switch Confirmation

After the mode is changed, have language_manager_node publish a confirmation message on /tts/text  in the newly selected language, e.g.:

English mode: "Okay, I will continue in English."

Malay mode: "Baiklah, saya akan bercakap dalam Bahasa Melayu."

Unsupported Language Fallback

If a user requests a language outside the supported set, language_manager_node should publish on  /tts/text:

"Sorry, I currently support only English and Malay."

Then remain in the previous language mode.


Storyboard
==========

### Scene 1: Personalised Greeting & Library Hours Query

Environment: Juno on the library front desk

User Action: A student pauses in front of the camera.

System Response:

-   The Juno camera detects the student's face and matches it to the user database.

-   Speaker plays: "Hello, Eric(student name)! How can I help you today?"

User Action: Eric asks: "Hey Juno, when's the library open?"\
System Response:

1.  Wake-word detection: The /wake_word topic triggers STT.

2.  STT/NLU: Converts speech to text: "When's the library open?" ‚Üí Extracts intent opening_hours and keyword library.

3.  Knowledge lookup: Calls /campus_info_service to fetch library hours from the database.

4.  TTS: Speaker responds: "The main library is open from 8 AM to 10 PM today."

### Scene 2: Campus Shuttle Inquiry¬†

###\
User Action: Student asks: "Hey Juno, when's the next shuttle bus to KK12?"

###\
System Response:

1.  Intent detection: NLU identifies shuttle_schedule intent and destination "KK12".

2.  Bus service: Queries the bus database for the next departure.

3.  TTS: *"The next shuttle bus departs at 3:00 PM from UM Central."*

Backend Process:

-   shuttle_query service filters the schedule CSV and returns the closest match.

Scene 3: Language Switch Request
--------------------------------

### User Action

-   Eric: "Hey Juno, do you speak Malay?"

### System Process

-   /wake_word triggers /stt/request

-   STT Client Node:

-   Uses current language (en-US) to transcribe

-   NLU Processor Node:

-   Detects intent: language_switch

-   Entity extracted: "Bahasa Melayu"

### Language Manager Node

-   Subscribed to /intent or  /language_switch

-   Validates request: "Bahasa Melayu" ‚àà [English, Bahasa Melayu]

-   Updates:

-   ROS Param /language_mode: ms-MY

-   Publishes on  /language_mode:  ms-MY

-   Publishes to /tts/text (in Malay):\
    Output: "Baiklah, saya akan bercakap dalam Bahasa Melayu."
